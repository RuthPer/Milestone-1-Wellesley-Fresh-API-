# Team Logs

**Week 1:**
We forgot to make the team_log.md file, but we completed milestone 1 and met in person for roughly 5 hours. We would often at time during this section meet up to work on the code collaboratively on one device for example on the creation of the database section.

**Ruth:** Worked on editing the wellesley fresh api so that I would work more with our code and them commited that information to the repo. Then with the team we started to work on fixing the datetime issues that we ran into. Then we worked on having a json files and creating specific json files to display to the users.I then worked to create the streamlit file with yuneydy and then add the code to create a clander and display the date a user selects in streamlit. Also help to formulate our project timeline. 

**Yuneydy:** I created the streamlit.py file and separated it from our other file to make our code more organized overall. I also added dictionaries for the locations so we can properly search and display locations and meals using their ids. For our dataframe, we worked together to add it using streamlit functions and on how exactly we should display all the data we were searching for. Lastly, to add some more organization visually, we added the containers around the different filters we were searching by and submitted our last version

**Dianna:** I provided the starrer code to make requests to the Wellesley API that Ruth later edited to fit our app. I joined a bit late to the in-person meeting because I had to go to work, but I joined and helped with the dataframe issues we were having. 

**Week 2:**
4/8/25 - We met from 1-3pm to work on Milestone 2. We started working on a shared Google Doc to solidify our idea.

4/9/2025 - We met from 7-10pm to work on milestone 2. Where we finshed up our slide show. 

**Ruth:** I worked on formulating the the ACM ethics slide where we worked to think of various ideas such as wellbeing of students via various features. I also worked on creating the slide mock up section by displaying key features that we would like to show to the user and gave detailed break downs of what each button presented would add to our application. Overall we all where able to each add small section and corrections to the various other slides. By working on the slide mock ups on canva we where also able to formulate new ideas and features for our application in the process. I also create a google docs where we all worked on to track our progress throughout the assignment. 

**Yuneydy:** I worked mainly on our slides and creating my teams ER diagram. Throughout the time we worked together, I had to continuously update the ER diagram to the different different features we wanted to add and made sure to update relationships between tables. Additionally, I also created the logo for our project on Canva (Pending) to use across all of our app slides. On the slides, I helped set up the "Our Ideas" slides and make our presentation look visually pleasing, similar to a simple pitch deck.

**Dianna:** I worked on mostly on the key features and outlining the app so that Ruth could make a mock-up. I also created the rough outline of the contract, allowing the rest of the team to add more agreements that I may have missed. I also asked Crystal for help on the databases and relayed the information she gave me to Yuneydy, who was making the ER diagrams. I also reached out to El Table and got the contact information of the main person in charge.
